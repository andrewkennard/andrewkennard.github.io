I am a PhD student in Biophysics at Stanford University, working in the lab of 
[Julie Theriot](https://www.biology.washington.edu/people/profile/julie-theriot), 
who recently moved to the University of Washington Department of 
Biology (so did I). I am a cell biologist interested in how cells move rapidly 
in response to physical changes in their environment; I study the cues that 
target skin cells to wounds in zebrafish embryos as a model system for this 
behavior. I use a combination of fluorescence microscopy and quantitative 
image analysis to understand the rapid dynamics of cells during this process.

I received my Masters from the University of Cambridge (Emmanuel College) 
under the direction of [Pietro Cicuta](http://people.bss.phy.cam.ac.uk/~pc245),
 studying how populations of bacteria maintain a constant average size despite 
rapid, exponential growth and division. Before that I received my Bachelor's 
degree from Harvard College, where I investigated how cyanobacteria cope with 
high light stress in the lab of Erin O'Shea.

I believe that everyone's life can be enriched by an appreciation of science 
or practicing the scientific method, and more must be done to reduce barriers 
to access to scientific knowledge and careers. I co-founded 
[Stanford Future Advancers of Science and Technology](https://fast.stanford.edu/),
 an outreach organization that partners students in San Jose high schools with 
PhD mentors; over the course of an entire year students and mentors work 
together to design and carry out an original science project that matters to 
the student. In my 3 years with the organization I saw it expand from 50 
students and 20 mentors to 180 students and 40 mentors across STEM disciplines.

Outside the lab I enjoy listening to jazz and playing jazz piano, and I have 
been recently exploring photography for fun, not just as a research tool.
