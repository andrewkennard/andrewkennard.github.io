I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Biology department of
UMass Amherst](https://www.bio.umass.edu/biology/), working in the lab of [Lilian
Fritz-Laylin](http://www.fritzlaylinlab.org). I am a cell biologist, interested
in uncovering fundamental principles underlying cellular organization and dynamics.
I am currently trying to understand how cytoskeletal networks evolve and diversify, 
with a particular focus on the microtubule cytoskeleton during cell division. 
I pursue this question in the emerging model organism
[_Naegleria gruberi_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4929615/),
a single-celled eukaryote which last shared a common ancestor with yeast and 
humans well over a billion years ago, and which has developed [unique innovations
in its microtubule cytoskeleton](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11753955/).
My work has been supported by a Ruth Kirschstein National Research Service Award (F32) 
from the National Institutes of Health (NIGMS).


I received my PhD in Biophysics from Stanford University in 2021, working in the lab of 
[Julie Theriot](https://sites.uw.edu/theriotlab/), 
now at the University of Washington Department of 
Biology. During my PhD I studied the influence of [mechanical](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(23)00616-4) and 
[electrical](https://elifesciences.org/articles/62386)
forces on cell migration in the context of the rapid wound healing response in larval zebrafish
skin.

I received my Masters from the University of Cambridge (Emmanuel College) 
under the direction of [Pietro Cicuta](http://people.bss.phy.cam.ac.uk/~pc245),
 studying how populations of bacteria maintain a 
[constant average size](https://air.unimi.it/retrieve/handle/2434/608086/1147337/PhysRevE.93.pdf)
despite 
rapid exponential growth and division. Before that I received my Bachelor's 
degree from Harvard College, where I investigated how cyanobacteria cope with 
high light stress in the lab of [Erin O'Shea](https://www.hhmi.org/scientists/erin-k-oshea).

I believe that everyone's life can be enriched by an appreciation of science 
or by practicing the scientific method. More must be done to reduce the barriers 
to accessing scientific knowledge, and to combat the systems of oppression that
obstruct the flourishing of anyone in a scientific career. To address
some of the barriers faced by first-generation college students interested in
STEM, I co-founded 
[Stanford Future Advancers of Science and Technology](https://fast.stanford.edu/),
 an outreach organization that partners students in Bay Area high schools with 
PhD mentors. Over the course of an entire year, students and mentors work 
together to design and carry out an original science project that matters to 
the student. In my 3 years with the organization I saw it expand from 50 
students and 20 mentors to 180 students and 40 mentors across STEM disciplines.

Outside the lab I enjoy walks in the woods and improvising on the piano, and I have 
been recently exploring photography for fun, not just as a research tool.
